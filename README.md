# Jeopardy GameTime

## Project Description
> http://frontend.turing.io/projects/jeopardy.html
> For this project you will learn object-oriented programming (OOP) principles by building the game Jeopardy. This is an opportunity to work with classes to build a program at a larger scale than you have with previous projects. This is also an opportunity for you to build out a program based on user stories - which is more aligned to what you can expect to see working with product managers in a production environment.
